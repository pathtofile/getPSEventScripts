# Get-PSEventScripts

## Overview
With PowerShell v5 came the ability to do Deep Script Block Logging.
This logging will contains all script blocks run by PowerShell.
This means that if a malicious script uses dynamic code genetation to hide what it is doing
(Such as scripts generated with Invoke-Obfuscation), all steps of the codem, inclding the final unobfuscated
script block, will be logged as plain text.

This Module will parse these event logs and extract all these scripts, obfuscated or not, into seperate
runanble .ps1 files, to either manually analyze, submit to VirusTotal, or execute inside your own Sandbox runner.


## Installation
Simply import the `getPSEventScripts.psm1` module (enabling an execution policy that alows scripts),
and use it by calling `Get-PSEventScripts`:
```
powershell -ep Unrestricted
ImportModule .\getPSEventScripts.psm1
Get-Help Get-PSEventScripts
```

## Options
This module also lets you filter out known-good scripts, filter by date range, and even parse events that were
exported from another machine.

Run `Get-Help Get-PSEventScripts -detailed` for all the paramaters.


## Usage
Run `Get-Help Get-PSEventScripts -examples` for more examples:
1. Get all scripts in the past 24 hours
```
Get-PSEventScripts -startTime (Get-Date).AddHours(-24)
```

2. Get all scripts that aren't simple oneliners or single interactive commands, by only getting scripts of a moderate character length
```
Get-PSEventScripts -minScriptLen 500
```

3. Get all scripts, besides any scripts in either the current user's local .vscode folder, or the current folder where this script is run.
```
Get-PSEventScripts -ignorePaths (Get-Item -Path ".\" -Verbose).FullName, "$env:USERPROFILE\.vscode"
```

4. Get all scripts from a log you got from another machine, that you exported as "pshellog.evtx"
```
Get-PSEventScripts -logfile pshellog.evtx
```
